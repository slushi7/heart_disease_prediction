Chronic Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest

# About the dataset:
The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.

# Goal of the project:
The World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk.

# Conclusion:
The model was struggling to predict 1 i.e. prone to CHD.

This is due to the inbalance in the dataset.

We can imporve the model by doing the following:

  1. Balancing the target variable by performing undersampling or smote.
  2. Figuring out the best hyperparameters by performing a gridsearch.
